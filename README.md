# üí™üèº Azure CLI hero.

We love the CLI üíô. Cheatsheet with the most common Microsoft Azure CLI commands with examples. 

Each section covers one specific set of resources you can manage with your CLI. Per each section you will find the following information:

- **Title**: The resources set name that you can manage with the CLI
- **Command**: Remember this one. It's the basic thing to start. For instance, `az group` is all about manage resource groups.
- **Basic actions**: Basic actions you can do in the command. Tip: mentally join command and basic action and you will be at half way to use the CLI to manage the resource.
- **Examples**: Set of examples using that command and the basic actions. First, it is described in human expression what you want to perform and the line after, the command that perform the action. Try to link the way of thinking and the sequence of the command and you will never forget a command again. 

Note: In the examples is assumed that all the actions are based on your subscription account.
